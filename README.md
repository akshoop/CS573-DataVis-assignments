WPI class notes and assignments

These files are projects, labs, and assignments that I finished during the Spring 2018 semester.
The professor used a private repository for all students in the class; from this private repo the professor made sub-repos, and students forked from them and then did their developments.
All of my code that I developed from the class is here.
